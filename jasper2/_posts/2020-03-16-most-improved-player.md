We will build through the draft. It has been the promise of losing franchises in every sport. For teams that lack Miami's beaches, California's glitz and glam or whatever makes people like Boston so much, it has often been seen as the only opportunity to create a contender. (Is this true? How many NBA champions in the last 20 years have rosters "built through the draft"). 

In 2019 the Toronto Raptors forged a different path, winning the NBA finals with a roster highlighted by an old-trade (Kyle Lowry), the Most Improved Player (Pascal Siakam) and a basketball god they traded for with one year left on his contract (c'mon now). While it should be noted that Pascal was selected through the draft, the main principles that led to the championship were player development and savvy trading. What hidden gems should teams be angling for in trades under the auspices that they will blossom into the next Siakam? And can these gems be found with a Python notebook [editor's note, probably not].

To start, we're going to need a lot of data. Free NBA API is your friend for this. Once. We've. Painstakingly. Put. That. Dataset. Together.
